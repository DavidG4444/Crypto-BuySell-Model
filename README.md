# Crypto-BuySell-Model
This serves as a capstone project for my Data Science/ML course at LuxDev HQ.

The goal is to create a fully functioning ML system that:

-   Fetches real historical crypto data
-   Cleans and engineers features
-   Calculates technical indicators
-   Generates labels for Buy/Sell/Hold
-   Trains a classification model
-   Evaluates performance and backtests strategy
-   Serializes the trained model
-   Deploys prediction logic (optional)

This is a realistic applied-finance ML workflow similar to what quant
researchers build.
